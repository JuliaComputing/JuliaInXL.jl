## Quick Usage Guide

If JuliaInXL was installed via the package manager, then in most cases a Julia process should launch automatically when starting your Excel session.

A Julia tab will also be present in the Office Ribbon that contains a number of buttons and text boxes for controlling the connection between Julia and Excel, as well as loading functionality into the current Julia process.

Julia functions can be called from Excel using the jlcall worksheet function. The first argument to jlcall is a string, which is the name of the registered Julia function to be called. Subsequent arguments to the jlcall function are passed as parameters to the Julia function being called. These can be constant literals, or cell references
